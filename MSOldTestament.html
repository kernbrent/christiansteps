<h2>
        Old Testament Overview/Survey - <i>Putting the pieces together</i>
    </h2>
    <p>There are many great stories, great people, miracles, and interactions with God our Father found in the Old Testament scriptures. We will spend 4 weeks understanding how many of these things fit together. Many people have heard the stories or have heard of the patriarchs of our faith, but few have a picture of how they fit together. What happened first? Was David the one who built the first temple or was it his son Solomon? If Abraham is seen as the father of the faith, why do the 12 tribes of Israel come from Abraham's grandson. And speaking of the 12 tribes of Israel, why are their 13 tribes listed? We will explore these questions and many more.</p>
