<h2>
        A study of the Book of James - <i>Consider It All Pure Joy</i>
    </h2>
    <p>Consider it pure <b>joy</b>, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds. Clearly whoever wrote this statement never went through what we go through today. He must not have known the troubles we have or what we go through on a daily basis in this 21st century society. Oh wait, the author was none other than James the brother of our Lord Jesus. And, yes, he faced many trials and was still able to be joyful enough to write these ancient (yet extremely relevant) instructions down for people to learn over two millenia. This passage comes from James 1:2. The second verse of the entire letter holds this life changing instruction. Imagine what the rest of the letter holds. This study of James was designed for men of all Christian backgrounds to study and understand the impact of the power of this letter written original to the Jewish Christians of the first century. </p>
