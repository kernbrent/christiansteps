<p>
  There are seasons when the heart quietly asks, “Is there something more? Is God leading me into something new?
  Am I doing enough—or am I falling behind?” We can carry those questions for a long time. Sometimes what we need
  most is not a new plan, but a steadier place to stand.
</p>

<p>
  Scripture gives that steady ground in a simple truth: <strong>God does not change</strong>. His love is not a moving target.
  His mercy is not conditional on a perfect week. His presence is not dependent on our emotional strength.
  The God who called His people in the wilderness, who sustained them through failure and restoration, is the same God
  who meets us today.
</p>

<h4>A hymn born from Scripture</h4>
<p>
  One of the most beloved hymns in Christian worship is “Great Is Thy Faithfulness.” Its words were written by
  Thomas Chisholm—an ordinary man by the world’s standards, without public fame or remarkable accomplishments.
  Yet his simple testimony has strengthened countless believers across generations.
</p>

<p>
  The hymn echoes a passage that has comforted God’s people for centuries:
</p>

<blockquote class="card" style="margin:1rem 0; padding:1rem 1.05rem;">
  <p style="margin:0 0 .6rem;">
    “Because of the Lord’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.
    They are new every morning; <strong>great is your faithfulness</strong>.” (Lamentations 3:22–23)
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0;">
    “It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord.” (Lamentations 3:26)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Lamentations does not pretend life is easy. It speaks honestly about affliction, wandering, bitterness, and grief.
  Yet in the middle of that honesty, it anchors hope in God’s unchanging heart. The turning point is not a change in
  circumstances—it is a change in what the soul “calls to mind.”
</p>

<h4>Security beyond success or failure</h4>
<p>
  One of the most exhausting burdens we carry is insecurity: the fear that we will fail, the worry that we are not enough,
  the dread that our mistakes will cost us everything. But Scripture repeatedly shows that true security comes from something
  greater than outcomes.
</p>

<p>
  When our confidence rests on performance, we live either paralyzed by fear or driven by exhaustion. But when our security
  is rooted in our Father’s love, we gain courage to attempt the hard things—because even if outcomes change,
  <strong>the relationship does not</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Nothing can separate you from God’s love</h4>
<p>
  Romans 8 is one of the clearest declarations of God’s unwavering commitment to His people. It does not minimize trouble,
  hardship, persecution, or danger. Instead, it places every threat under a greater promise:
</p>

<blockquote class="card" style="margin:1rem 0; padding:1rem 1.05rem;">
  <p style="margin:0 0 .6rem;">
    “I am convinced that neither death nor life… neither the present nor the future… nor anything else in all creation,
    will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:38–39)
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0;">
    “In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.” (Romans 8:37)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Many people quietly wonder whether their sins and mistakes can destroy their relationship with God. We may fear that God
  will give up on us, or that we’ve crossed a line too far to return. Those thoughts come naturally to the human mind—
  because people do give up on people. But Romans 8 insists on something different: <strong>God’s love in Christ is not fragile</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  This does not mean we treat sin casually. It means we refuse the lie that God’s love is easily broken. You can ignore Him,
  resist Him, or run from Him, but He does not become someone else. Like the father in the story of the prodigal son,
  He remains watchful, ready, and compassionate—running toward the returning child rather than hiding behind a locked door.
</p>

<h4>“I the Lord do not change”</h4>
<p>
  The prophet Malachi captures the stability of God’s character with striking clarity:
</p>

<blockquote class="card" style="margin:1rem 0; padding:1rem 1.05rem;">
  <p style="margin:0;">
    “I the Lord do not change.” (Malachi 3:6)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  That statement is not meant to make us afraid, as if God’s firmness exists only to judge. In Malachi, it is actually mercy:
  because God does not change, His people are not destroyed. His covenant love remains. He even invites His people to return:
  “Return to me, and I will return to you.”
</p>

<p>
  Hebrews echoes this same confidence:
</p>

<blockquote class="card" style="margin:1rem 0; padding:1rem 1.05rem;">
  <p style="margin:0;">
    “Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.” (Hebrews 13:5) <br/>
    “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.” (Hebrews 13:8)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Discipline is not abandonment</h4>
<p>
  Some people struggle with passages where God “tests,” “humbles,” or “disciplines.” It can feel like rejection.
  But Deuteronomy frames God’s discipline as a father’s love:
</p>

<blockquote class="card" style="margin:1rem 0; padding:1rem 1.05rem;">
  <p style="margin:0;">
    “As a man disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplines you.” (Deuteronomy 8:5)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Discipline is not God turning His back. It is God shaping His children toward life. He knows what destroys us and what heals us.
  He knows where pride hardens and where dependence strengthens. And even when we fail, Nehemiah reminds us that God’s compassion
  is steady:
</p>

<blockquote class="card" style="margin:1rem 0; padding:1rem 1.05rem;">
  <p style="margin:0;">
    “But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love…
    Therefore you did not desert them.” (Nehemiah 9:17)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Love that forms us</h4>
<p>
  In seasons where the world emphasizes scarcity, fear, and shifting loyalties, Scripture calls us back to the nature of love:
</p>

<blockquote class="card" style="margin:1rem 0; padding:1rem 1.05rem;">
  <p style="margin:0;">
    “Love is patient, love is kind… It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” (1 Corinthians 13:4–7)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  God shows us His will not only through what He commands, but through who He is—so we can become more like Him.
  The aim of the Christian life is not merely self-improvement. It is union with Christ:
</p>

<blockquote class="card" style="margin:1rem 0; padding:1rem 1.05rem;">
  <p style="margin:0;">
    “I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.” (Galatians 2:20)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Because God is faithful, we can learn to be faithful. Because He is patient, we can learn patience. Because His love does not keep
  a record of wrongs, we can release bitterness and practice forgiveness. His unchanging character becomes our compass.
</p>

<h4>Quiet confidence in an unchanging Father</h4>
<p>
  If you find yourself in a season of uncertainty, consider this: the greatest comfort is not that you can control the future,
  but that the One who holds you does not change. His compassions are new every morning. His love in Christ is not separable.
  His presence is not a temporary contract.
</p>

<p>
  So you can wait quietly and faithfully. You can take the next step. You can attempt the impossible with humble courage—
  not because outcomes are guaranteed, but because you are secure in the Father who will not abandon you.
</p>

<p style="margin-top:1.2rem;"><strong>To God be all the glory.</strong></p>
