<h3 id="article-section">An invitation to step into God’s rhythm</h3>
<article class="card" style="max-width: 980px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
<p>
              From the very beginning, God revealed that time itself would carry meaning. Genesis opens by showing
              that creation was not random or accidental. Even when the earth was “without form and void,” it was
              never without a plan. God created with intention—ordering light, days, and seasons so that life could
              be measured, remembered, and guided.
            </p>
<p>
              In Genesis 1:14, God establishes the heavenly lights “for signs and seasons.” The word translated
              <em>seasons</em> is often understood as <strong>appointed times</strong>—God’s set appointments in time.
              In other words, the idea of God’s sacred calendar isn’t introduced later as a human tradition; it is
              built into the creation week itself.
            </p>
<h4 style="margin-top:1.25rem;">1) God placed His appointments into creation</h4>
<p>
              If God designed time with purpose, then God’s appointed times are not distractions from the gospel—
              they are signposts that point to it. The Holy Days teach us to look at life through God’s story:
              redemption, transformation, Spirit-led living, the return of Christ, restoration, and the Kingdom to come.
            </p>
<h4 style="margin-top:1.25rem;">2) The Holy Days are found throughout the Bible</h4>
<p>
              God’s Holy Days appear across the Old Testament as memorials of what God has done and as teaching tools
              for what God will do. But they also show up in the New Testament—within the life and ministry of Jesus
              and the early Church. Rather than treating these days as irrelevant, the New Testament consistently uses
              their themes to explain Christ’s work and the believer’s hope.
            </p>
<p>
              When we trace the Scriptures, we see a unified message: God is redeeming a people, transforming hearts,
              and moving history toward a promised conclusion. The Holy Days help believers rehearse that message,
              year after year, in a way that stays close to the Bible’s own storyline.
            </p>
<h4 style="margin-top:1.25rem;">3) Jesus observed the Holy Days</h4>
<p>
              Jesus did not stand apart from God’s appointed times—He stepped into them. He kept Passover, taught
              during festival seasons, and used these moments to reveal truth about Himself and the Kingdom.
              The Holy Days are not merely “about Israel”; they are about God’s plan, and Jesus is at the center of that plan.
            </p>
<p>
              When we honor what Jesus honored, we’re not trying to earn righteousness. We’re choosing discipleship:
              letting the rhythms of Scripture shape our worship and our understanding. The Holy Days become a way
              to focus our hearts on Christ, not a way to compete with Him.
            </p>
<h4 style="margin-top:1.25rem;">4) The Holy Days reach into the end times and the Kingdom</h4>
<p>
              The Bible’s prophetic horizon does not erase God’s appointed times—it often amplifies them. The themes
              announced in these days—resurrection hope, the coming reign of Christ, reconciliation, and restoration—
              are the very themes the prophets and apostles proclaim as history moves toward its climax.
            </p>
<p>
              This gives the believer a gentle question to consider: if God’s appointed times were embedded in creation,
              illuminated in the Law and Prophets, honored by Jesus, and echoed in the future hope of the Kingdom,
              might they still be meaningful for Christians today?
            </p>
<h4 style="margin-top:1.25rem;">A persuasive, not argumentative encouragement</h4>
<p>
              Keeping God’s Holy Days is not about winning debates. It’s about receiving an invitation.
              Many believers first approach these days with uncertainty—because they seem ancient, unfamiliar,
              or “not Christian.” But as you explore them, you may discover something surprising: they are deeply
              Christ-centered, rich with Scripture, and filled with beauty and hope.
            </p>
<p>
              We at Christian Steps believe God’s Holy Days are relevant to Christians today—not as a burden,
              but as a blessing. Understanding them can help you understand your Savior Jesus just a little bit more.
            </p>

              To God be all the glory.
