        <h2>Understanding Service</h2>

        <div class="text-with-image">
          

          <p><strong>Service</strong> is a deep desire to give yourself to a cause greater than yourself for God’s glory. Those with a high need for service find life most meaningful when they are actively helping, building, and leaving a lasting impact—not for personal recognition, but as an act of worship.</p>

          <p>In church life, this motivation often appears through hands-on ministry and faithful involvement in the body of Christ. You may thrive as an usher welcoming families, teaching children, leading worship, organizing outreach, or serving behind the scenes. These roles allow you to steward your gifts for the common good, reflecting the unity of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12–27). Scripture affirms this calling: “Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others” (1 Peter 4:10). Jesus Himself modeled this posture: “The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve” (Matthew 20:28).</p>

          <p>If service is your highest motivation, you are drawn to meaningful causes and eternal impact. You often measure fulfillment by how much good you can do and may meet many of your emotional, spiritual, and relational needs through generous action. Your courage, persistence, and willingness to step forward inspire others.</p>

          <p>However, a strong drive to serve can lead to neglecting your own needs or the needs of those closest to you. When service becomes all-consuming, loved ones may feel overlooked, and your health may suffer. Scripture reminds us that even devoted servants like Elijah needed rest and restoration (1 Kings 19:3–8). Jesus invites the weary to come to Him for rest (Matthew 11:28).</p>

          <p>You may also struggle with control, especially when injustice is present or others do not share your passion. While your desire for righteousness is admirable, remember that God is the ultimate judge: “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord” (Romans 12:19). Learning to release outcomes to God and trust His timing brings peace and clarity.</p>

          <p>A high need for service can create intensity—always needing to be strong, decisive, and active. This can block vulnerability and strain relationships. God invites you to slow down, listen, and allow Him to work in His way and time: “Be still, and know that I am God” (Psalm 46:10).</p>

          <p>When balanced with rest, humility, and trust, your heart for service strengthens the church and glorifies God. Rooted in Christ, your service becomes joyful rather than exhausting—an overflow of love that builds others up while keeping your soul healthy and whole.</p>

        <h3>Spiritual Reflection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Am I serving from love or from pressure to always be needed?</li>
          <li>Where might God be calling me to rest or slow down?</li>
          <li>Are my closest relationships receiving the same care I give to causes?</li>
          <li>How can I trust God more with outcomes beyond my control?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- RANK 2–3 -->

        <h2>Service (Summary)</h2>

        <p>Service is the desire to give yourself to a cause greater than yourself for God’s glory. When it is your strongest motivation, you thrive in meaningful ministry, using your gifts to build the church and bless others, following Christ’s example of servant leadership (Matthew 20:28; 1 Peter 4:10).</p>

        <p>At its best, service brings purpose and impact. Without balance, it can lead to burnout, control, or neglect of personal needs. God invites you to serve from a place of rest, trust His timing, and allow love—not pressure—to guide your generosity.</p>

        <h3>Spiritual Reflection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Am I allowing rest to be part of my service?</li>
          <li>Do I trust God with justice and outcomes?</li>
          <li>Where can I serve with greater humility and grace?</li>
