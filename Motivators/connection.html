        <h2>Understanding Connection</h2>

        <div class="text-with-image">
          
          <p><strong>Connection</strong> is a deep desire for love, belonging, and meaningful relationship. Those with a high need for connection surround themselves with people they care about and often find their sense of worth through relationships. They are sensitive, idealistic, and deeply moved by suffering, reflecting the biblical call to “bear one another’s burdens” (Galatians 6:2).</p>

          <p>If connection is your highest core motivation, you value generosity toward those near you. You nurture, protect, and take responsibility for your own people. Usually gentle and kind, you can become fiercely protective when relationships are threatened, echoing Scripture’s call to “bear with one another in love” and to “keep the unity of the Spirit” (Ephesians 4:2–3).</p>

          <p>Your empathy draws people to you. Friends, family, and even strangers often come to you with their problems because you listen well and genuinely care. You enjoy helping and often offer wise counsel. Giving of your time, attention, and possessions energizes you, and separation from loved ones can feel deeply painful.</p>

          <p>However, your strength can also become a vulnerability. You may give so much to others that you neglect your own needs. The desire for love can shift into a need to be needed, creating fear of being dispensable. This can lead to over-involvement, difficulty saying no, or feeling responsible for fixing others.</p>

          <p>Learning to ask yourself what you truly want before committing is essential. Saying “no” may feel uncomfortable, but honoring your limits protects both you and your relationships. Scripture reminds us that while we share burdens, each person is also responsible for their own load (Galatians 6:2, 5).</p>

          <p>At times, connection can become tied to suffering. Because people feel understood when they share pain with you, they may linger in their struggles longer than necessary. Gently encouraging others to grow, heal, and take responsibility helps them mature rather than remain dependent (James 1:2–4).</p>

          <p>You may worry deeply about others and feel distressed when your care is unrecognized or rejected. Investing too heavily in difficult or draining relationships can leave you exhausted or resentful. Scripture calls you to guard your heart, practice gratitude, and give thanks in all circumstances (Proverbs 4:23; 1 Thessalonians 5:18).</p>

          <p>Above all, remember that God loves you for who you are, not for what you give (Romans 5:8). Establishing healthy boundaries honors God and protects your body and spirit, which are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19–20). Letting go of guilt and standing your ground teaches others how to treat you.</p>

          <p>When your connection is healthy, you become a powerful force for unity in the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12). Rooted in Christ’s unconditional love, you are free to give joyfully, receive gracefully, and encourage true interdependence—strengthening the church without control, dependency, or burnout.</p>

        <h3>Spiritual Reflection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Where might God be inviting me to set healthier boundaries?</li>
          <li>Do I know what I truly need before saying yes to others?</li>
          <li>Is my identity rooted in Christ’s love or in being needed?</li>
          <li>How can I encourage others to grow rather than depend on me?</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- RANK 2–3: TWO-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY -->
      <div id="rank2to3" class="rank-section">
        <h2>Connection (Summary)</h2>

        <p>Connection is a deep longing for love, belonging, and meaningful relationships. When it is your strongest motivation, you naturally nurture, protect, and care for others, often becoming a trusted listener and companion who reflects Christ’s call to unity and shared burdens (Ephesians 4:2–3; Galatians 6:2).</p>

        <p>At its best, connection builds community and strengthens the church. Yet without healthy boundaries, it can lead to over-giving, fear of rejection, or dependency. Rooting your identity in God’s unconditional love allows you to give freely, say no when needed, and foster relationships marked by mutual growth rather than control or exhaustion.</p>

        <h3>Spiritual Reflection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Am I giving from abundance or from a need to be needed?</li>
          <li>Where do I need clearer boundaries in relationships?</li>
          <li>How can I stay rooted in Christ while loving others well?</li>
        </ul>
