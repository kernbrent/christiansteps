        <h2>Understanding Stability</h2>

        <div class="text-with-image">
          <p><strong>Stability</strong> is the desire for safety, consistency, and dependable structure. People with a high need for stability feel most at peace when life is predictable, commitments are honored, and trust is built over time. They value faithfulness, order, and reliability, reflecting the steady nature of God, who “does not change like shifting shadows” (James 1:17).</p>

          <p>If stability is your strongest motivation, you are drawn to routines, clear expectations, and environments where you know what is required of you. You work best when roles are defined and promises are kept. Sudden change, ambiguity, or chaos can feel unsettling, not because you lack faith, but because you are wired to create calm, order, and continuity for yourself and others.</p>

          <p>In church life, stability often shows up as quiet faithfulness. You are the one who shows up consistently, serves behind the scenes, and keeps ministries running smoothly. Others may overlook your contribution because it feels “normal,” but Scripture honors this kind of steadfastness: “It is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful” (1 Corinthians 4:2).</p>

          <p>You often become a grounding presence in the body of Christ. When emotions run high or plans shift, your steadiness helps others feel safe. You remember details, honor traditions, and protect what has been built. Like the wise builder who constructs on solid rock (Matthew 7:24–25), you value foundations that endure storms.</p>

          <p>Your challenge comes when stability turns into resistance. Change, innovation, or risk can feel threatening, even when God is the one initiating movement. You may cling to familiar patterns or struggle to trust new leadership, new methods, or new seasons. Scripture reminds us that while God is constant, He often leads His people into new territory (Isaiah 43:19).</p>

          <p>You may also carry anxiety about the future, working hard to prevent loss, failure, or disruption. When uncertainty arises, you might tighten control or withdraw emotionally. God invites you to anchor your security not in systems or routines, but in His presence: “Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7).</p>

          <p>Healthy stability is rooted in trust—trusting God even when the path is unclear. As you learn to hold routines loosely and faith firmly, your steadiness becomes a gift rather than a limitation. You model perseverance, patience, and long obedience in the same direction.</p>

          <p>When grounded in Christ, your need for stability strengthens the church. You help create safe spaces, reliable structures, and faithful rhythms where others can grow. By trusting God through change and remaining open to His leading, you become both an anchor and a bridge—holding fast to truth while moving forward in faith.</p>

        <p>At its best, stability strengthens the church through perseverance and trust. Without balance, it can resist change or increase anxiety, so God invites you to anchor your security in Him—remaining steady while staying open to His movement and growth.</p>
